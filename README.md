# LSM R Code
This repository contains R code for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping along a major highway in Nepal using Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning (ML) Techniques. 
To use the code correctly, following files that are prepared before introducing them into R environment would be required: 
1.) Training Datasets in CSV format
2.) Testing Datasets in CSV format
3.) Rasters of Landslide Determinants
