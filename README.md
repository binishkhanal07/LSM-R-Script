This repository contains R code for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping along a major highway in Nepal using Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning (ML) Techniques. 
To use the code correctly, following files should be prepared before introducing them into R environment: 
1.) Training Datasets in CSV format
2.) Testing Datasets in CSV format
3.) Landslide Determinants in Raster format
