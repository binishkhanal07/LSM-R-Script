# LSM R Script
This repository contains R Script for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping along a major highway in Nepal using Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning (ML) Techniques. 
To suitably use the codes, following files should be prepared before introducing them into the R environment: 
1.) Training Datasets in CSV format
2.) Testing Datasets in CSV format
3.) Landslide Determinants in Raster format
